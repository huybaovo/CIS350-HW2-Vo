# Huy Vo
- I like the Monster Hunter and Armorcore series a lot.
- I have learned a variety of programming languages but I am most comfortable with JavaScript and Kotlin.
- I am currently working on a personal mobile application for android using Kotlin on the side for fun.
- Fishing, reading, and cooking are some of my other hobbies to pass time.

## Technical Background
I have experience in using many different programming languages and I also have experience in programming web applications and mobile applications. I have used GitHub plenty of times for my college courses and for personal projects. While I have plenty of experience in a variety of programming, all of my experience is only from university and I wish to gain industry experience.
